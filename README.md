## Potential Ideas
- Work item management system
  There is an existing need for software to manage and maintain company work items. By "work item", I mean a physical piece of paper with information about the specific job (for example, job location, material cost, laborer pay rate, time to completion/ % of job completed).
  This is a common way to keep track of work for companies who have not modernized to a digital environment.
