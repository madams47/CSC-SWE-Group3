## Potential Ideas
Work item management system
- There is an existing need for software to manage and maintain company work items. By "work item", I mean a physical piece of paper with information about the specific job (for example, job location, material cost, laborer pay rate, time to completion/ % of job completed).
- This is a common way to keep track of work for companies who have not modernized to a digital environment.

Nearby chat rooms
- An idea I had while going on a road trip
- Similar to a trucker-style radio, the app will search for other phones that have the app within a certain radius (say, 2 miles), and allow you to request a connection with them to chat
- This sounds like a daunting project. But including it here in case it sparks another idea

Video streaming from computer to phone
- If you're ever away from home, but want to monitor something around your house, just point your computer's webcam at it and you will be able to stream the live feed from your phone.
- Might need to add some flashy features so we have a need for a database.
- Maybe we could use AI to detect and alert when something out of the ordinary happens. Push notification to phone to suggest the user check out what's going on with their video stream.
